This work explores two reinforcement learning (RL) strategies for Drives Optimization in the context of cognitive architectures for autonomous robots. Guided by Hull's Drive Theory, we investigate an early vs. late selection mechanism to optimize drive reduction via RL, focusing on agents motivated by curiosity and survival needs. 

The **1-QDO** approach employs a single Q-Table to manage and balance both drives simultaneously, while **2-QDO** utilizes two separate Q-Tables, prioritizing the most critical drive at any moment.
